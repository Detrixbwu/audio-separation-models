# Demucs4 HT

Demucs4 HT (2022) splits a track into 4 stems (bass, drums, vocals, other). It excels at bass/drums/other separation.

**Variants**  
- **htdemucs_ft**: Best quality, slower inference  
- **htdemucs**: Faster, lower quality  
- **htdemucs_6s**: Adds piano & guitar stems (quality still early)
